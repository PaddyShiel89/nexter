nexter is a site designed by Jonas Schmedtmann as part of his [Advanced CSS and Sass course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/). I completed the course, then translated it into a Gatsby project and made a variety of changes and additions.

Jonas' original site design can be found at [https://nexter.netlify.com/](https://nexter.netlify.com/).
